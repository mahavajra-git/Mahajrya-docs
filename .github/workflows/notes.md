## Collaboration Workflow Notes

- User works from both Android app and desktop, issuing instructions via speech-to-text (Android keyboard or other tools) that result in text commands for me.
- I interpret each text instruction and operate inside Cursor to redact or update project documents accordingly.
- I acknowledge instructions only when I have actionable answers or have completed the requested work.

## Formatting & Documentation Approach

- Notes stay in plain Markdown so they are easy to read and edit from any device.
- Use succinct headings and bullets; reserve code fences only when quoting commands or snippets.
- Track each document we touch so we always know where updates live.

## Active Documents

- `notes.md` (this file) – running record of our agreed workflow and formatting system.
